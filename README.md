# Voice Assistant using Python

This project implements a voice assistant using Python. The voice assistant is capable of recognizing user voice commands, processing them, and executing corresponding actions. The project is built using various technologies such as speech recognition, natural language processing, and text-to-speech conversion.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You also need to install the following libraries:

- `pyttsx3`: for text-to-speech conversion
- `SpeechRecognition`: for speech recognition

### Installing

You can install the required libraries using `pip`. Run the following commands to install the libraries:

```
import pyttsx3
import datetime
import speech_recognition 
import wikipedia
import webbrowser 
import os
import pyautogui
from time import sleep

```



### Running the Program

To run the program, simply execute the `main.py` file:

```
python main.py
```

The voice assistant will start listening for user commands. You can speak commands such as "What's the weather like today?" or "Play some music" and the assistant will process them and execute the corresponding action.
